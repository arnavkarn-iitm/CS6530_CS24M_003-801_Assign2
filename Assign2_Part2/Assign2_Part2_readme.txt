Part 2: Double-and-Add Algorithm on secp256k1

Files:
    1. doubleAndAddAlgorithm.py
    2. assign2-part2.txt

How to Run:
    1. Go to the Assign2_Part2 directory in your terminal.
    2. Execute the script to compute points for scalars 1201, 3966, and 4207 using double-and-add:

    python doubleAndAddAlgorithm.py

    3. This creates assign2-part2.txt containing binary expansion, algorithm steps, and final results.

Notes:
    1. Python 3.6+ required.
    2. The script imports from Part 1, so keep the folder structure intact.
