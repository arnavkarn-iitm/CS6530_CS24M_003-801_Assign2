Part 3: ECDSA Signature and Verification (secp256r1)

Files:
    1. ECDSA.py
    2. assign2-part1-part2-combined_logs.txt
    3. assign2-part3.txt

How to Run:
    1.  Go to the Assign2_Part3 folder.
    2. To combine part 1 and part 2 logs, run:

    python ECDSA.py

    This will:
        1. Merge the logs as assign2-part1-part2-combined_logs.txt
        2. Generate and verify the signature using ECDSA (with r, s) on the combined log.
        3. Record all signing and verification steps in assign2-part3.txt.

Notes:
    1. Python 3.6+ is needed.
    2. All signature and verification details are captured in assign2-part3.txt for peer/TA review.
